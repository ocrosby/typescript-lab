## Types

There is already a small set of primitive types available in JavaScript: 

- boolean, 
- bigint, 
- null, 
- number, 
- string, 
- symbol, and 
- undefined, 

which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as:

- any (allow anything), 
- unknown (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), 
- never (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and 
- void (a function which returns undefined or has no return value).
